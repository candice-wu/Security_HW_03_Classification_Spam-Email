User: Please explain the OpenSpec workflow from openspec/AGENTS.md and how I should work with you on this project
Agent: The OpenSpec workflow is a structured, three-stage process for managing project changes through spec-driven development.

**Stage 1: Creating Changes (Proposal)**
This stage is for proposing significant changes like new features, breaking changes, or architectural shifts. It involves:
1.  **Understanding Context:** Reviewing `openspec/project.md`, existing specs, and pending changes.
2.  **Choosing a `change-id`:** A unique, verb-led ID (e.g., `add-user-auth`).
3.  **Scaffolding:** Creating a `changes/<change-id>/` directory with:
    *   `proposal.md`: Explains *why*, *what*, and *impact*.
    *   `tasks.md`: An implementation checklist.
    *   `design.md` (optional): For complex changes.
    *   `specs/`: "Delta specs" detailing `ADDED`, `MODIFIED`, `REMOVED`, or `RENAMED` requirements with scenarios.
4.  **Validation:** Running `openspec validate <change-id> --strict`.
5.  **Approval:** Waiting for your approval before implementation.

**Stage 2: Implementing Changes**
Once approved, implementation proceeds by:
1.  Reading `proposal.md`, `design.md` (if present), and `tasks.md`.
2.  Implementing tasks sequentially and marking them complete.

**Stage 3: Archiving Changes**
After deployment, the change is archived by moving its directory to `changes/archive/` and updating main `specs/` if necessary.

**How we'll work together:**
*   I will always refer to `openspec/project.md` and existing specs for context.
*   For significant changes, I will create an OpenSpec proposal for your review and approval.
*   I will implement changes only after your approval, tracking progress via `tasks.md`.
*   I will ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requests and use `openspec validate` for correctness.

Now, I'm ready to create your first change proposal (Task 2).

User: 請先產生一個 "prompt.txt"，把「我提問的」與「你回覆的」須「即時」記錄到「prompt.txt 檔案」，請疊加記錄不要覆寫
Agent: Okay, I will create a `prompt.txt` file and append our conversation to it as we go.

First, I'll create the `prompt.txt` file.

--- openspec/changes/add-spam-email-classifier/proposal.md ---

## Why
To enhance the project's capabilities by adding a "Spam Email Classifier" feature. This will allow for the prediction of spam emails and provide a web-based interactive interface using Streamlit.

## What Changes
- Implement a machine learning algorithm for spam email classification.
- Expand preprocessing steps for email content.
- Add richer visualization for step outputs, metrics, and results.
- Develop CLI and Streamlit views for interaction and presentation.
- Integrate the Streamlit application as the deliverable.

## Impact
- Affected specs: New capability for spam email classification.
- Affected code: Introduction of new Python modules for classification, preprocessing, visualization, and Streamlit application.

## Context
This proposal outlines the addition of a "Spam Email Classifier" to the project, leveraging Python and Streamlit for an interactive web application. The core functionality involves machine learning for classification, enhanced data preprocessing, and comprehensive visualization.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals:
    - Develop an accurate spam email classification model.
    - Provide rich visualizations of model performance and intermediate steps.
    - Create an intuitive Streamlit web interface for user interaction.
    - Adhere to CRISP-DM methodology for project structure and documentation.
- Non-Goals:
    - Real-time email processing from an inbox.
    - Advanced natural language generation for email responses.

## Decisions
- **Classification Algorithm:** To be determined during implementation, considering common NLP classification techniques (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, or deep learning approaches if complexity allows).
- **Visualization Libraries:** Streamlit's native charting components and potentially Plotly/Matplotlib for custom visualizations.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Will involve tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF, Word2Vec).

## Risks / Trade-offs
- **Model Accuracy:** Risk of lower accuracy with limited dataset; mitigation through careful feature engineering and model selection.
- **Performance:** Streamlit application performance with large datasets or complex visualizations; mitigation through optimization and efficient data handling.

## Migration Plan
N/A (new feature)

## Open Questions
- Specific machine learning libraries to be used (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Detailed design of CLI arguments and Streamlit UI layout.

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Spam Email Classification
The system SHALL accurately classify incoming email content as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

#### Scenario: Classify spam email
- **WHEN** a user provides email content identified as spam
- **THEN** the system SHALL classify it as "spam" with high confidence

#### Scenario: Classify ham email
- **WHEN** a user provides email content identified as ham
- **THEN** the system SHALL classify it as "ham" with high confidence

### Requirement: Enhanced Preprocessing
The system SHALL apply advanced text preprocessing techniques to email content before classification.

#### Scenario: Tokenization and cleaning
- **WHEN** raw email text is input
- **THEN** the system SHALL tokenize, remove stop words, and perform stemming/lemmatization

The system SHALL provide rich visualizations of preprocessing steps, model metrics, and classification results.

#### Scenario: Display preprocessing output
- **WHEN** preprocessing is performed
- **THEN** the system SHALL display visual representations of intermediate preprocessing steps (e.g., word clouds, token counts)

#### Scenario: Display model metrics

### Requirement: Streamlit Web Interface
The system SHALL provide an interactive web interface using Streamlit for user input, classification, and visualization.

#### Scenario: User inputs email content
- **WHEN** a user enters email content into the Streamlit interface
- **THEN** the system SHALL display the classification result and relevant visualizations

#### Scenario: User views model metrics

User: Can you add more acceptance criteria for the input UI, and output at least have Interactive dashboard for data distribution, token patterns, and model performance?
