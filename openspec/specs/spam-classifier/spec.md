# spam-classifier Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-spam-email-classifier. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Spam Email Classification
The system SHALL accurately classify incoming email content as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

#### Scenario: Classify spam email
- **WHEN** a user provides email content identified as spam
- **THEN** the system SHALL classify it as "spam" with high confidence

#### Scenario: Classify ham email
- **WHEN** a user provides email content identified as ham
- **THEN** the system SHALL classify it as "ham" with high confidence

### Requirement: Enhanced Preprocessing
The system SHALL apply advanced text preprocessing techniques to email content before classification.

#### Scenario: Tokenization and cleaning
- **WHEN** raw email text is input
- **THEN** the system SHALL tokenize, remove stop words, and perform stemming/lemmatization

### Requirement: Rich Visualization
The system SHALL provide rich visualizations of preprocessing steps, model metrics, and classification results.

#### Scenario: Display preprocessing output
- **WHEN** preprocessing is performed
- **THEN** the system SHALL display visual representations of intermediate preprocessing steps (e.g., word clouds, token counts)

#### Scenario: Display model metrics
- **WHEN** the classification model is evaluated
- **THEN** the system SHALL display key performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix)

### Requirement: Streamlit Web Interface
The system SHALL provide an interactive web interface using Streamlit for user input, classification, and visualization.

#### Scenario: User inputs email content via text area
- **WHEN** a user enters email content into a dedicated text area in the Streamlit interface
- **THEN** the system SHALL process the input for classification and display the result

#### Scenario: User inputs email content via file upload
- **WHEN** a user uploads a file containing email content to the Streamlit interface
- **THEN** the system SHALL process the content for classification and display the result

#### Scenario: Interactive dashboard for data distribution
- **WHEN** the Streamlit application is accessed
- **THEN** the system SHALL display an interactive dashboard visualizing the distribution of data (e.g., spam vs. ham counts, word frequency)

#### Scenario: Interactive dashboard for token patterns
- **WHEN** the Streamlit application is accessed
- **THEN** the system SHALL display an interactive dashboard visualizing token patterns (e.g., n-gram frequency, word clouds)

#### Scenario: Interactive dashboard for model performance
- **WHEN** the Streamlit application is accessed
- **THEN** the system SHALL display an interactive dashboard visualizing model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curve)
