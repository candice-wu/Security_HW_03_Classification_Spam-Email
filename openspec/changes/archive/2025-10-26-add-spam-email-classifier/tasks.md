## 1. Initial Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Set up project environment and dependencies (requirements.txt).
- [x] 1.2 Implement data loading and initial preprocessing for sms_spam_no_header.csv.
- [x] 1.3 Develop the spam email classification model.
- [x] 1.4 Implement expanded preprocessing steps.
- [x] 1.5 Create visualization components for step outputs and metrics.
- [x] 1.6 Develop CLI interface for model interaction.
- [x] 1.7 Develop Streamlit application for web interaction and visualization.
- [x] 1.8 Integrate all components into the main application (5114050013_hw3.py).
- [x] 1.9 Write unit tests for classification model and preprocessing steps.
- [x] 1.10 Create README.md with project introduction based on CRISP-DM and Streamlit demo link.

## 2. Project Upgrade: Interactive Multi-Model Platform
- [x] 2.1 Refactor training script (`5114050013_hw3.py`) to support multi-model training (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest).
- [x] 2.2 Create `models/` directory to store serialized model files.
- [x] 2.3 Completely redesign `streamlit_app.py` into a multi-page application.
- [x] 2.4 Implement "Live Prediction" page with model selection and probability display.
- [x] 2.5 Implement "Batch Prediction" page with CSV upload and download functionality.
- [x] 2.6 Implement "Model Comparison" page with performance metrics table and F1-score visualization.
- [x] 2.7 Implement "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)" page with class distribution, message length analysis, and word clouds.
- [x] 2.8 Ensure all new library dependencies (`wordcloud`) are in `requirements.txt`.
- [x] 2.9 Update `README.md` to reflect all new features, architecture, and usage instructions.
- [x] 2.10 Update `README_CN.md` with the translated content of the new README.
- [x] 2.11 Update `openspec/proposal.md` to outline the new project goals and scope.
- [x] 2.12 Update `openspec/design.md` with the detailed architecture of the multi-model system and Streamlit app.
- [x] 2.13 Update this `tasks.md` file to log the completion of the upgrade tasks.
